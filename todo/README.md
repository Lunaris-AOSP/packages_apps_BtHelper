# To Do

- To Do list for BtHelper
- May or may not implemented to BtHelper in the future

* [ ] Make BtHelper correctly handles multiple devices on pods service (Help wanted!!)
* [ ] Make BtHelper correctly report device type to Bluetooth app and system (No more unknown device)
* [ ] Better OnePod mode
* [ ] Correctly handles persistable uri permission check (Remove Settings app hack)

* [x] Receive Battery Information
* [ ] Set/Receive ANC Modes
* [ ] Set Adaptive Audio Noise settings
* [x] Receive In-Ear detection Status
* [ ] Personalized Volume (idk how this works, if it received data from icloud, or is purely from airpods)
* [ ] Conversational Awareness
* [x] Ear Detection
* [ ] Head Gestures
* [ ] Siri (Voice assistant on long stem press)
* [ ] Hold and Press configuration (this is really weird, mac sends different packets based on what the current status is, instead of a fixed packet for what the current button state is, like common there's only so many to map out numbers to states)
* [ ] Case Charging Sounds
* [ ] Rename AirPods
* Accessibilty
  - [ ] Press Speed
  - [ ] Press and hold duration
  - [ ] Noise Cancellation with one AirPod
  - [ ] Tone Volume
  - [ ] Toggle Volume Control on Swipe (APP only, i believe)
  - [ ] Volume Swipe (Normal/Longer/Longest)
  - [ ] Headphone accomodation (I literally can't tell the difference between any samples played, lol, also, idk if this is something that the mac does)
  - [ ] Audio Tuning (idk if this is also smth that mac does)
  - [ ] Customize Transparency Mode (This is gonna take some while to parse, it is 103 bytes :(... probably all the 4 sliders and 1 switch under this is sent as a whole)
